API Introduction
================

You cannot touch API and it is not possible to see it, however these days it indirectly influences everybodyâ€™s lives.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to find out, what APIs are - actually. `The article on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`__ begins with an explanation, that it is an application programming interface (API) and continues with professional technical text, which common mortals have difficulties to understand. This document is trying to explain API **on the common example using plain words**.
